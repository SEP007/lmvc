Learning Model View Controller
------------------------------

This project contains a very small MVC framework written with simple PHP classes. It's not for production use but for learning purpose. It's developed with the following boundary conditions:

* Just PHP - no external PHP libraries
* Convention over configuration
* No annotations or other stuff like that

Currently there is no documentation for anything. But there is a simple tweet function implemented.
